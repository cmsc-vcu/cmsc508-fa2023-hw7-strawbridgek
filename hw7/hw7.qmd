## Overview and description

Shows the database of a company that showcase skills and roles based upon different people that work there.

## Crows-foot diagram

This diagram shows of the attributes of the custumer. Which is their id, first name, and last name. The customer uses delivery address which has a id. The customer also uses places to get orders.

```{mermaid}
%%| echo: false
erDiagram
    CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
    CUSTOMER }|..|{ DELIVERY-ADDRESS : uses
    CUSTOMER{
        int id
        string first_name
        string last_name
    }
    DELIVERY-ADDRESS {
        int id
    }
```

## Examples of data in the database

For the people, skills, and roles tables, provide a description of each table and it's contents. Then provide a listing of the entire table.

### People table

The *people* table contains elements that describe ... 

Below is a list of data in the *people* table.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
sql = f"""
select * from people;
"""
## Add code to list roles table here
try:
    df = pd.read_sql(sql,cnx)
    df
except Exception as e:
    message = str(e)
    print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df
```

### Skills table

The *skills* table contains elements that describe ... 

Below is a list of data in the *skills* table.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

## Add code to list roles table here
```

### Roles table

The *roles* table contains elements that describe ... 

Below is a list of data in the *roles* table.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

## Add code to list roles table here
```


## Sample queries

Let's explore the database!

# List skill names, tags, and descriptions ordered by name

(here a sample query)

```{python}
sql = f"""
select * from people
"""
```


(and here is a sample result from the query)

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
try:
    df = pd.read_sql(sql,cnx)
    df
except Exception as e:
    message = str(e)
    print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df

```


### List people names and email addresses ordered by last_name


### List skill names of Person 1


### List people names with Skill 6


### List people with a DEVELOPER role


### List names and email addresses of people without skills


### List names and tags of unused skills


### List people names and skill names with the BOSS role


### List ids and names of unused roles
